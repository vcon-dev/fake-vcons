How can I assist you today?\n\nWell, I'm feeling a bit anxious about the quality of your piano lessons. I've heard mixed reviews and I'm not sure what to expect.\n\nI understand your concern, Cynthia. Our school prides itself on offering top-notch instruction. May I ask how you heard about us?\n\nI found out about Harmony Music School through a friend who took violin lessons.\n\nThat's great to hear! Could you also let me know how long you're interested in taking lessons for?\n\nI'm considering enrolling for three months initially, just to see how it goes.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Our instructors are highly qualified, and we tailor our lessons to meet individual needs. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n\nNo, I think that covers everything.
