Thank you for calling West Barnstable Horse Hides, your friendly local bowling alley. My name is Alex. How can I assist you today?\n\nHi Alex! I'm calling about a billing issue I encountered. My name is Jamie.\n\nNice to meet you, Jamie! Could you please tell me how I can help with your billing issue?\n\nSure, I noticed an extra charge on my bill from my last visit, and I wanted to clarify what it was for.\n\nI see. Let me take a look into that for you. Can I have your billing account number? It's the one that starts with a five.\n\nYes, it's five six seven eight.\n\nGreat, thank you. Also, can I confirm the last four digits of the phone number associated with your account for verification purposes?\n\nSure, the last four digits are nine zero two one.\n\nThank you, Jamie. I have found your account. It looks like the extra charge was for some snacks from the vending machine. Does that sound right?\n\nOh, yes, I forgot about that.
