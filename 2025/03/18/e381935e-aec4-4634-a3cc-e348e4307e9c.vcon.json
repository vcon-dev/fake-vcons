My name is Carl Evans. May I have your name, please?\n\nHi Carl, my name is Janice Anderson.\n\nNice to meet you, Janice. How can I assist you today?\n\nWell, I'm feeling quite confused about the quality of your piano lessons. I want to know more.\n\nI understand, Janice. Can you please tell me what specific concerns you have about the piano lessons?\n\nI'm not sure if the lessons are suitable for my ten-year-old daughter. Are the instructors qualified?\n\nAbsolutely, all our instructors hold at least a bachelor's degree in music and have over five years of teaching experience.\n\nThat's comforting to hear. What about the lesson plans? Are they standardized, or do they vary for each student?\n\nOur lesson plans are tailored to fit each student's individual needs. To recommend a plan, can you tell me your daughter's current experience with piano?\n\nShe has been playing for about two years, but mostly on her own.\n\nGreat, with two years of self-taught experience, we can customize an intermediate level course that will challenge and grow her skills.\n\nThat sounds promising, Carl. Thank you for the information.\n\nYou're welcome, Janice. Thank you for reaching out. If you have further questions, feel free to contact us any time.
