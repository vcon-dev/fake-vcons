Thank you for calling Melody Makers Music School. My name is Joshua Smith. How can I assist you today?\n\nHi, Joshua. My name is Jessica Perez. I'm looking to check on the availability of some instruments for my class, but I'm a bit confused about the process.\n\nOf course, Jessica. I'd be happy to help you with that. Could you please let me know which instruments you are interested in?\n\nI was thinking about getting five violins, but I\u2019m not sure if you have that many in stock.\n\nLet me check our inventory for violins. I\u2019ll need a bit more information first. Could you please provide the instrument model number you are considering?\n\nThe model number is V-one-two-three-four.\n\nGreat, thank you. Also, could you confirm your preferred pickup date for the violins?\n\nI'm hoping to pick them up by the end of next week, if possible.\n\nI'll check our stock and see if we can accommodate that timing. Is there anything else I can assist you with while I inquire about the violins?\n\nNo, that would be all for now. Thank you.\n\nThank you for providing the details, Jessica. I will get back to you shortly with the inventory status. I appreciate your time and patience today.
