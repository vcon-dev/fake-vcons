I'm not feeling my best today, but I wanted to inquire about your pricing.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're feeling down, Patricia. Let me help you with the information you need. Could you tell me which instrument you are interested in learning?\n\nI'm interested in piano lessons. I hope they are not too expensive.\n\nWe offer a variety of pricing options. Could I also have your zip code to check for any location-specific offers?\n\nSure, my zip code is nine zero one two three.\n\nThank you. Let me check that for you, Patricia.
