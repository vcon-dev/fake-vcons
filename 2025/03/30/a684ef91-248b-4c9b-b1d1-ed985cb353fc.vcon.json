Let me help you get to the bottom of this. Could you please tell me your account number?\n\nSure, the account number is one two three four five.\n\nThank you, Martha. I see your account here.

Let me check that for you. I see there was a charge for an additional class on the tenth of last month. Did you not attend this class?\n\nNo, I didn't.
